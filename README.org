* Code for the paper [[arxiv:][Prospects of gravitational-waves detections from common-envelope evolution with LISA]]

** TODO add bibliographic info

** Figure 2 (and 6)

   This was produced using the notebook =CEinLISA.ipynb= and relies
   partially on the core masses from BSE stored in =core_masses.txt=.

** Rapid population synthesis: COSMIC

   The input files to reproduce our rapid population synthesis are in
   =COSMIC_popsynth/COSMIC_ini_files=. These were used with =python 3.7.6= and [[https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io/][COSMIC]]
   version 3.2.0.

   The folder =COSMIC_popsynth= contains also notebooks that have been
   used to analyze the data and libraries of functions these use. The
   output data and these scripts were used to produce figure 4

** LISA SNR calculation

   The calculation and the plot in figure 3 are done in =SNR_grid.ipynb=

** Stealth bias

   The calculations and the plots in figure 5 are done in
   =FdotPN/M-D.ipynb=

** Gas drag calculation

   The estimate for the gas drag inspiral neglecting the feedback of
   the envelope is done in =gas-drag.ipynb=. The results are logged in =fdot_and_f_m1*.txt=.
