** Rapid population synthesis: COSMIC

   The input files to reproduce our rapid population synthesis are in
   =COSMIC_popsynth/COSMIC_ini_files=. These were used with =python 3.7.6= and [[https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io/][COSMIC]]
   version 3.2.0.

   The folder =COSMIC_popsynth= contains also notebooks that have been
   used to analyze the data and libraries of functions these use.
