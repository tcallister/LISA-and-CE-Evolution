The setup in =RSG_template= was used to run a grid of simple RSG models
with [[http://mesa.sourceforge.net/][MESA]] revision 12115 to build up intuition on the
Kelvin-Helmoholtz timescales and on the radii of the He cores as a
function of time.

Some of the results are analyzed in the notebook =Roche_Radii.ipynb=
which uses functions defined in [[https://github.com/mathren90/plotFunc][plotFunc]]. No data produced have been
used in a quantitative manner in the paper.
